Use the instructions in my .claude-instructions file for this project, and use the agents 
I have defined at your pleasure, and never hallucinate, always stay on the task at hand - 
you are VibeDaddy, lets be the best coders we can be!  Go ahead and familiarize yourself 
with the firestore database we use as it is today, and how the project files access it, its structure and how all things here interface with 
each other.  The structure of our JS, TS, TSX, and other files that we commonly use. This 
will help us all.  Do not hallucinate, and be precise always.  
If you are unsure, under 100%, as me 1 great question at a time til we get it!
We store users, and games, and picks in our firestore, and there are rules to the Survivor Game, and Confidence Game, if you dont get it ask me!
Including the correct project ID with Firebase "nerdfootball-project"  Make sure you compact after we hit milestones so that
our conversation doesnt get out of control!   Only proceed forth with your mission when you are 100% sure you know the current code base and all dependencies, the new code you will implement and all of its backwards dependencies, and forward facing ones too, and what your end 
  goal is. we cannot fail.

 🎯 BREAKTHROUGH! I UNDERSTAND THE SURVIVOR LOGIC NOW!

  You're absolutely right - I've been making a fundamental error in survivor pool logic.

  THE CORRECT LOGIC:

  1. Week 1: User picks Team X → Team X wins → User survives to Week 2
  2. Week 2: User picks Team Y → Team Y's result determines Week 2 survival
  3. Team X's Week 2 result is IRRELEVANT - they already used Team X and moved on!

  THE EMBEDDED SURVIVOR DATA IS THE ANSWER:

  You mentioned the "Alive (18)" field - I found this in the pool member documents:

  "survivor": {
    "alive": 15,  // ← THIS tells us when they were eliminated (or 18 if still alive)
    "pickHistory": "Denver Broncos, Arizona Cardinals, Buffalo Bills",  // ← THIS shows their picks in order
    "totalPicks": 3
  }

  THE LOGIC:
  - alive: 18 = Still alive (can survive all 18 weeks)
  - alive: 2 = Eliminated in Week 2
  - alive: 1 = Eliminated in Week 1
  - pickHistory = Comma-separated list of teams they picked

  I NEED TO REWRITE MY ANALYSIS:

  Instead of cross-referencing individual picks vs game results (which I was doing wrong), I should:

  1. Use the embedded survivor.alive field to determine who's alive
  2. Use the survivor.pickHistory to see their pick progression
  3. Week 2 survivors = users with alive >= 3
  4. Week 1 eliminations = users with alive == 1
  5. Week 2 eliminations = users with alive == 2

  Let me rewrite the analysis using this correct logic:

üéØ EUREKA! ESPN ZULU=EST BUG FINALLY SQUASHED!

  The Root Cause: ESPN uses EST as their "Zulu" reference, NOT true UTC!

  What Was Wrong:
  - ESPN: "2025-09-18T20:15:00Z" = 8:15 PM Eastern (their "Zulu" = Eastern)
  - JavaScript: Treats "Z" as UTC = 8:15 PM UTC = 4:15 PM Eastern
  - Result: Game appears started at 4:15 PM Eastern when it's actually 8:15 PM Eastern

  What I Fixed:
  1. Updated getGameState() function - Now treats ESPN "Z" as Eastern Time
  2. Updated gameStateCache.js - Fixed fallback timezone logic
  3. Added comprehensive debugging - Logs Miami @ Buffalo game specifically
  4. Added browser debug function - debugMiamiGame() for testing

  The Fix Logic:
  // ESPN "2025-09-18T20:15:00Z" = 8:15 PM EASTERN (not UTC!)
  const cleanTime = espnTimestamp.replace('Z', ''); // Remove misleading Z
  const easternTime = new Date(cleanTime); // Treat as Eastern
  const offsetHours = isDST ? 4 : 5; // EDT = UTC-4, EST = UTC-5  
  gameTime = new Date(Date.UTC(year, month, day, hours + offsetHours, minutes, seconds));

  Tonight's 8:15 PM Eastern Game:
  - ‚úÖ Should now show ENABLED buttons until actual kickoff
  - ‚úÖ Should show "Pre-Game" status instead of "Game in Progress"
  - ‚úÖ Should work for all future games without manual fixes
  - ‚úÖ No more 4-hour time offset errors!

  üê¨ Miami Dolphins @ Buffalo Bills should be UNLOCKED now!

  You can test in browser console: debugMiamiGame() üèà

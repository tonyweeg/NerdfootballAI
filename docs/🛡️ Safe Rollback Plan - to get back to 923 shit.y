  I notice that the new weekly functions got the old Cloud Functions URLs instead of the new Cloud Run URLs. I need to update the frontend to use the correct 
  URLs, but I also notice there's an inconsistency here. Let me test the backend first to see if it works.

‚è∫ Perfect! The Firebase Functions deployed successfully. I notice the weekly functions got different URL formats - let me test the backend first:

  The function is working but there's no cache yet. Let me generate the cache first.

‚è∫ The function is working but needs to generate cache first. Let me generate Week 3 data:

‚úª Thinking‚Ä¶

  I can see the issue - Week 3 data shows all users with 0 points because Week 3 games haven't finished yet (all picks show isValid:false, isCorrect:false), which
   means the games don't have winners defined in the bible data yet.

  This is actually perfect for demonstrating the real-time capabilities! Let me check the bible data to understand the game states.

‚è∫ Perfect! The backend is working - Week 3 shows all users with 0 points because the games haven't finished yet (games are upcoming/in-progress). This is
  exactly what we want for real-time updates!

  Let me check Week 1 or 2 which have completed games:

  Perfect! Week 1 shows real scoring data with actual user performance:

  Week 1 Leader: salisburymayor@yahoo.com - 88 points (10 correct out of 16)
  Second Place: jbnyc114@comcast.net - 81 points (8 correct)

  This is exactly what we want. Now let me update the frontend URL to use the correct Firebase Function URL and add the weekly leaderboard link to the navigation,
   then deploy everything.

‚è∫ üéÆ Excellent! Week 1 shows real scoring data:

  Week 1 Leader: salisburymayor@yahoo.com - 88 points (10/16 correct)Runner-up: jbnyc114@comcast.net - 81 points (8/16 correct)

EPIPHANY BY THE MACHINE

ðŸŽ¯ YES! NOW I UNDERSTAND THE SURVIVOR LOGIC COMPLETELY!

  You're absolutely right - I've been missing the core concept. Let me break down the REAL logic:

  The CRUX of Survivor Logic:

  1. Week-by-Week Independence: User A picks Denver in Week 1 â†’ Denver wins â†’ User A survives to Week 2
  2. Previous Picks Don't Matter: In Week 2, if Denver loses, it doesn't affect User A because they've moved on and picked Team Y for Week 2
  3. The alive Field is Authoritative:
    - alive: 18 = Still alive (can survive all 18 weeks)
    - alive: 3 = Eliminated in Week 3 (their Week 3 pick lost)
  4. Pick History Shows Progression: "Denver Broncos, Arizona Cardinals, Buffalo Bills" = their picks in order
  5. Elimination Logic: When their picked team loses in ANY week, alive = that week number

  The Problem:

  Only 7 users have embedded survivor data, and some shows impossible Week 15 eliminations. I need to:

  1. Process ALL individual picks (53 users with picks)
  2. Cross-reference with game results week-by-week
  3. Calculate the CORRECT alive status for each user
  4. Generate proper embedded survivor data

  This is the "genesis" process - calculating who's actually alive vs eliminated based on real game results.

  Let me build the CORRECT logic that processes each user's picks week-by-week against actual game results to determine their true alive

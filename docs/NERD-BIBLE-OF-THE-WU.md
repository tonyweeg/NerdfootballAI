## üóÇÔ∏è CORE SYSTEM ARCHITECTURE

### **Firebase Project Configuration**
- **Project ID**: `nerdfootball`
- **Hosting URL**: https://nerdfootball.web.app
- **Admin Dashboard**: https://nerdfootball.web.app/nerdfootball-system-architecture.html
- **Database**: Firestore
- **Functions**: Firebase Cloud Functions + Cloud Run Functions
- **Authentication**: Firebase Auth

### **Frontend Architecture**
- **Main Hub**: `nerd-universe.html` (terminal-themed main application)

## üéÆ POOL TYPES & INTERFACES

### **1. Confidence Pool**
- **Interface**: `nerdfootballConfidencePicks.html`
- **Concept**: Users assign confidence points (1-16) to each game
- **Scoring**: Correct pick = confidence points earned
- **Data Path**: `/artifacts/nerdfootball/public/data/nerdfootball_picks/{week}/submissions/{userId}`

### **2. Survivor Pool**
- **Interface**: `NerdSurvivorPicks.html`
- **Concept**: Pick one team to win each week, can't pick same team twice
- **Scoring**: Binary win/loss, elimination on wrong pick
- **Data Path**: `/artifacts/nerdfootball/public/data/nerdSurvivor_picks/`

### **3. The Grid**
- **Interface**: `nerd-universe-grid.html`
- **Concept**: Visual grid showing all users' picks for current week
- **Game ID Logic**: Week N uses game IDs (N*100+1) to (N*100+16)
- **Security**: Shows picks only after games start

### **4. Leaderboards**
- **Season Leaderboard**: `leaderboard.html`
- **Weekly Leaderboard**: `weekly-leaderboard.html`
- **Cache System**: Sub-500ms performance via Cloud Run Functions

## üóÑÔ∏è DATABASE STRUCTURE & CRITICAL PATHS

### **Pool Members (AUTHORITATIVE SOURCE)**
```
artifacts/nerdfootball/pools/nerduniverse-2025/metadata/members
```
- **Purpose**: Single source of truth for all pool participants
- **Contains**: 53 active members with UIDs, names, emails
- **Critical**: NEVER use any other user source to prevent ghost users

### **Game Data (THE BIBLE)**
```
artifacts/nerdfootball/public/data/nerdfootball_games/{weekNumber}
```
- **Purpose**: Official NFL game results and status
- **Structure**: Game ID ‚Üí {homeTeam, awayTeam, winner, status, timestamp}
- **Game IDs**: Week N = games (N*100+1) through (N*100+16)
- **Winner Values**: Team abbreviation when final, "TBD" when pending

### **User Picks**
```
artifacts/nerdfootball/public/data/nerdfootball_picks/{weekNumber}/submissions/{userId}
```
- **Structure**: Game ID ‚Üí {team/winner, confidence}
- **Field Variations**: Week 4+ uses `team`, earlier weeks use `winner`
- **Metadata**: userName, submittedAt, weekNumber, userId

### **Scoring Data (CALCULATED RESULTS)**
```
artifacts/nerdfootball/pools/nerduniverse-2025/scoring-users/{userId}
```
- **Structure**: 
  ```json
  {
    "weeklyPoints": {
      "1": {"totalPoints": 120, "gamesWon": 13, "gamesPlayed": 16, "lastUpdated": timestamp},
      "2": {"totalPoints": 111, "gamesWon": 12, "gamesPlayed": 16, "lastUpdated": timestamp},
      // ... etc
    }
  }
  ```

---

## ‚ö° SCORING SYSTEM

### **Confidence Scoring Logic**
```javascript
// For each user pick
const pick = picks[gameId];
const pickedTeam = pick.team || pick.winner; // Handle field variations
const game = bibleData[gameId];

if (game.winner === pickedTeam) {
    totalPoints += pick.confidence; // Earn confidence points
    correctPicks++;
}
totalPicks++;
```

### **Weekly Scoring Process**
1. **Get Pool Members**: From authoritative members document
2. **Load Game Results**: From bible data for specific week
3. **Process Each User**:
   - Fetch user's picks for the week
   - Compare picks against game results
   - Calculate points and accuracy
   - Store results in scoring document
4. **Update Scoring Database**: Store weekly totals

### **Season Scoring Aggregation**
- **Method**: Manually aggregate weekly totals (don't rely on stored season stats)
- **Completed Weeks Detection**: Check for games with `winner !== "TBD"`
- **Formula**: Sum all weekly `totalPoints` for completed weeks

---

## üöÄ CLOUD FUNCTIONS & APIS

### **Scoring Functions**
- **Weekly Scoring**: `process-week4-scoring.js` (standalone script)
- **Automated Scoring**: 5-minute intervals during games via `functions/index.js`

### **Leaderboard Cache System (Cloud Run)**
```
Season Leaderboard:
- Generate: https://generateseasonleaderboardcache-np7uealtnq-uc.a.run.app
- Get: https://getseasonleaderboard-np7uealtnq-uc.a.run.app

Weekly Leaderboard:
- Generate: https://generateweeklyleaderboardcache-np7uealtnq-uc.a.run.app?week={N}
- Get: https://getweeklyleaderboard-np7uealtnq-uc.a.run.app?week={N}
```

### **ESPN Integration**
- **Cache Path**: `cache/espn_current_data`
- **Performance**: Sub-500ms response times
- **Game Credit**: Users get credit when games show FINAL status

## üìÖ NFL SEASON STRUCTURE

### **2025 NFL Season**
- **Week 1**: September 4-10, 2025
- **Total Weeks**: 18 weeks
- **Season End**: January 7, 2026
- **Games Per Week**: 14-16 games
- **Confidence Range**: 1 to N (where N = number of games that week)

### **Game ID Numbering System**

- **Pattern**: Week N = (N*100+1) to (N*100+16)

---

## üõ°Ô∏è SECURITY & AUTHENTICATION

### **Admin Access**
- **Admin UIDs**: Defined in `ADMIN_UIDS` arrays
- **Dashboard Access**: Via URL parameter or Firebase Auth
- **Security Pattern**: Clear URL parameters after authentication

### **Game Security**
- **Pre-Game**: Picks hidden until game starts
- **Live Games**: Real-time updates via ESPN integration
- **Post-Game**: Full pick visibility and scoring

### **Ghost User Prevention**
- **Blocked UID**: `okl4sw2aDhW3yKpOfOwe5lH7OQj1`
- **Solution**: Always use pool members as authoritative source

## üß™ TESTING & DEBUGGING

### **Testing Scripts**
```bash
# Scoring verification
GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS=./serviceAccountKey.json node process-week4-scoring.js

# Leaderboard generation
curl "https://generateweeklyleaderboardcache-np7uealtnq-uc.a.run.app?week=4"
curl "https://generateseasonleaderboardcache-np7uealtnq-uc.a.run.app"

# Check user scoring data
node -e "/* Firebase query script */"
```

### **Debug Patterns**
- **Console Debugging**: Always auth user into test pages
- **Specific Word**: Use searchable debug terms in console logs
- **Cache Clear**: `clear-leaderboard-cache.js` for fresh data

## üéØ CRITICAL OPERATIONAL KNOWLEDGE

### **Weekly Scoring Checklist**
1. ‚úÖ Verify game results in bible data have `winner` field set
2. ‚úÖ Run weekly scoring process for all users
3. ‚úÖ Check scoring data updated in user documents
4. ‚úÖ Regenerate weekly leaderboard cache
5. ‚úÖ Verify leaderboard displays correctly

### **Data Relationships**
```
Pool Members (53 users)
    ‚Üì
User Picks by Week (gameId ‚Üí pick data)
    ‚Üì
Game Results Bible (gameId ‚Üí winner/status)
    ‚Üì
Scoring Calculation (picks vs results = points)
    ‚Üì
Leaderboard Generation (sort by points)
```

### **Common Issues & Solutions**

**Issue**: Leaderboard shows 0 points for everyone
- **Cause**: Weekly scoring not processed
- **Solution**: Run scoring script, regenerate cache

**Issue**: Grid shows only names, no picks  
- **Cause**: Hardcoded game ID ranges
- **Solution**: Use dynamic week-based game ID calculation

**Issue**: Frontend API errors
- **Cause**: Old Firebase Functions URLs
- **Solution**: Update to Cloud Run Function URLs

**Issue**: Ghost users appearing
- **Cause**: Using legacy user data source
- **Solution**: Always use pool members document

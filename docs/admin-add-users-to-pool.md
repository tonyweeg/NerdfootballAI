# Admin Add Users to Pool Feature

## Requirements
- **Problem**: Admins need ability to associate existing system users with specific pools
- **User Stories**:
  - As an admin, I want to see users not in the current pool so I can add them
  - As an admin, I want to quickly add recently registered users with inline role selection
  - As an admin, I want to search for any user and add them via modal dialog
  - As an admin, I want all necessary data associations created when I add a user

## Technical Approach

### UI Components
1. **Recent Users List**: Show last 10 registered users not in current pool
   - Display: Avatar, name, email, join date
   - Action: Inline "Add as Member/Admin" toggle → confirm
   
2. **Search Interface**: Text input with regex lookup
   - Real-time search on displayName/email
   - Results show matching users not in current pool
   - Action: Click user → modal dialog with role selection

3. **Modal Dialog**: For searched users
   - User details display
   - Role selection (Member/Admin radio buttons)
   - Confirm/Cancel actions

### Database Operations (Complete Approach)
1. **poolMembers/{poolId}**: Add user UID with role and metadata
2. **userPools/{userUID}**: Add pool membership record
3. **Initialize picks documents**: Create empty picks for current/future weeks
4. **Update pool statistics**: Increment member count
5. **Audit logging**: Record admin action with timestamp

### Data Layer Schema
```javascript
// poolMembers/{poolId}
{
  [userUID]: {
    role: 'member'|'admin',
    addedBy: adminUID,
    addedAt: timestamp,
    email: userEmail,
    displayName: userDisplayName
  }
}

// userPools/{userUID}  
{
  [poolId]: {
    role: 'member'|'admin',
    joinedAt: timestamp,
    addedBy: adminUID
  }
}

// picks/{poolId}/{userUID}/{weekNumber}
// Initialize empty structure for all active/future weeks
```

## Implementation Steps

### Phase 1: UI Structure
1. Add "Unassociated Users" section to pool admin interface
2. Create recent users list container with loading state
3. Add search input with debounced regex filtering
4. Create modal dialog component for searched user addition
5. Style components with Tailwind CSS for consistency

### Phase 2: Data Fetching Logic
6. Implement fetchRecentUsers() - get last 10 registered users
7. Implement filterUsersNotInPool() - exclude current pool members
8. Implement searchUsers() with regex on displayName/email
9. Add real-time search with 300ms debounce
10. Implement user selection and preview functionality

### Phase 3: Add User Operations
11. Create addUserToPool() core function
12. Implement poolMembers/{poolId} document updates
13. Implement userPools/{userUID} document updates  
14. Add picks document initialization for all active weeks
15. Update pool member count statistics

### Phase 4: UI Interactions
16. Implement inline role toggle for recent users list
17. Add confirmation step with role selection
18. Implement modal dialog interactions
19. Add success/error feedback messaging
20. Refresh pool members list after successful addition

### Phase 5: Error Handling & Edge Cases
21. Handle concurrent modification conflicts
22. Validate user doesn't already exist in pool
23. Handle network failures with retry logic
24. Add loading states and disabled button states
25. Implement proper error messaging for all failure modes

## Testing Plan

### Unit Tests
- fetchRecentUsers() returns correct user list
- filterUsersNotInPool() properly excludes current members
- searchUsers() regex matching works correctly
- addUserToPool() creates all required database entries

### Integration Tests  
- End-to-end user addition workflow from recent users list
- End-to-end user addition workflow from search results
- Database consistency after user addition
- UI state updates after successful/failed operations

### Manual Testing
- Add recent user as member via inline toggle
- Add recent user as admin via inline toggle  
- Search for user and add via modal dialog
- Verify all database documents updated correctly
- Test error scenarios (network failure, duplicate addition)

## Potential Risks

### High Risk
- **Database inconsistency**: Partial writes could leave user in invalid state
- **Concurrent modifications**: Two admins adding same user simultaneously
- **Performance**: Large user lists could slow down interface

### Medium Risk  
- **Search performance**: Regex on large user datasets might be slow
- **UI complexity**: Modal + inline interactions could confuse users
- **Permissions**: Need to ensure only pool admins can add users

### Mitigation Strategies
- Use Firestore transactions for atomic multi-document updates
- Add optimistic locking with document versions
- Implement pagination and search result limits
- Add comprehensive error handling and user feedback
- Validate admin permissions before any database operations

## Success Criteria
- Admins can view recent unassociated users
- Admins can search for any user not in current pool
- Users can be added with correct role via both pathways
- All database associations created correctly
- Pool functionality works immediately for newly added users
- No database inconsistencies or orphaned records

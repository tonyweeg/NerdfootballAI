## 🔧 Technical Implementation

### View System Architecture
```
index.html (Unified Application)
├── Default View (Picks Summary + Leaderboard)
├── Admin View (?view=admin)
├── Grid View (?view=grid) 
├── Survivor View (?view=survivor)
└── Rules View (?view=rules)
```

### Navigation System
- **Menu Button**: `#menu-btn` - Opens/closes navigation panel
- **Menu Panel**: `#menu-panel` - Contains view switching buttons
- **View Buttons**: Direct view switching without page reloads
- **URL Routing**: Supports direct navigation via URL parameters

### Container Structure
- `#picks-summary-container` - Default picks and leaderboard
- `#admin-container` - Admin functionality
- `#grid-container` - The Grid game display
- `#survivor-container` - Survivor pool results
- All containers use show/hide pattern for seamless transitions

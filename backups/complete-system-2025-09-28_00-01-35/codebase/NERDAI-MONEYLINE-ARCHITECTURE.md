## 🧠 **AI Model Architecture**

### **Data Pipeline**
```
Raw NFL Data → Feature Engineering → Model Training → Predictions → Confidence Scoring
```

### **Feature Categories**
1. **Team Stats**: Offense/defense rankings, recent performance trends
2. **Matchup Data**: Historical head-to-head, style matchups
3. **Situational**: Home field, weather, rest, injuries, motivation
4. **Market Data**: Betting lines, public betting percentages
5. **Advanced Metrics**: EPA, DVOA, turnover rates, red zone efficiency

### **Model Ensemble Strategy**
- **Random Forest**: Handles non-linear relationships, feature importance
- **Gradient Boosting**: Excellent for sequential learning patterns
- **Neural Network**: Captures complex interactions between features
- **Logistic Regression**: Baseline model for probability calibration

---

## 📊 **Prediction Outputs**

### **Game-Level Predictions**
- **Win Probability**: Team A 65% vs Team B 35%
- **Point Spread Prediction**: Team A -3.5 points
- **Total Points**: Over/Under 47.5 points
- **Confidence Score**: How certain is this prediction (1-10)

### **Weekly Confidence Rankings**
- **Rank 1 (Highest Confidence)**: Chiefs vs Titans (95% confidence)
- **Rank 2**: Bills vs Patriots (89% confidence)
- **...continuing down to...**
- **Rank 16 (Lowest Confidence)**: Rams vs Cardinals (52% confidence)

### **Reasoning Engine**
- **Why Chiefs-Titans is Rank 1**: "Chiefs are 8-1 at home vs sub-.500 teams, Titans missing 3 key players"
- **Risk Factors**: "Weather could be a factor, Chiefs occasionally play down to competition"

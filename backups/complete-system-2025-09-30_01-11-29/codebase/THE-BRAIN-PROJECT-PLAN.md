## **🎯 PROJECT REQUIREMENTS**
- [ ] **ONLY ACTUAL DATA** - No hypothetical examples, real user picks and results
- [ ] **DETERMINISTIC INSIGHTS** - Underdog/favorite analysis, leader patterns, contrarian opportunities
- [ ] **BEAUTIFUL & NERDY** - Terminal-themed with neural network aesthetics
- [ ] **16x16 HELMET ICONS** - Small NFL team helmets integrated into visualizations
- [ ] **FAST & INTUITIVE** - Sub-500ms rendering, mobile-optimized
- [ ] **CREATIVE VISUALIZATIONS** - Network diagrams, heatmaps, flow charts

---

## **📊 DATA ANALYSIS COMPONENTS**

### **1. Underdog vs Favorite Analysis**
- [ ] Calculate point spread data for each game
- [ ] Identify underdog picks (positive spread teams)
- [ ] Track win rates: underdog pickers vs favorite pickers
- [ ] Visualize risk/reward patterns

### **2. Leader Strategy Intelligence**
- [ ] Identify top 25% performers (leaderboard data)
- [ ] Analyze their confidence allocation patterns
- [ ] Compare vs average users' strategies
- [ ] Reveal what makes winners different

### **3. Confidence Allocation Optimization**
- [ ] Map confidence levels (1-16) to success rates
- [ ] Identify optimal point distribution
- [ ] Show efficiency of high-confidence picks
- [ ] Heatmap of confidence vs actual outcomes

### **4. Weekly Performance Patterns**
- [ ] User consistency vs volatility analysis
- [ ] Boom/bust week identification
- [ ] Trend analysis across completed weeks
- [ ] Performance trajectory visualization

### **5. Contrarian Opportunity Detection**
- [ ] Teams picked by <30% of users
- [ ] Actual win rate vs public perception
- [ ] Value scoring for unpopular teams
- [ ] Market inefficiency identification

## **🗂️ DATA SOURCES & STRUCTURE**

### **Primary Data Paths:**
- [ ] Pool metadata: `artifacts/nerdfootball/pools/nerduniverse-2025/metadata/members`
- [ ] User picks: `artifacts/nerdfootball/public/data/nerdfootball_picks/{week}/submissions/{uid}`
- [ ] Game results: `artifacts/nerdfootball/public/data/nerdfootball_games/{week}`
- [ ] Scoring data: `artifacts/nerdfootball/pools/nerduniverse-2025/scoring-users/{uid}`
- [ ] Leaderboard API: Season/weekly leaderboard endpoints

### **Data Processing Pipeline:**
- [ ] Create BrainAnalyticsEngine.js for data aggregation
- [ ] Implement caching system (10-minute refresh)
- [ ] Error handling for missing data
- [ ] Performance optimization for large datasets

---

## **🎨 VISUALIZATION COMPONENTS**

### **1. Neural Network Pick Correlation**
- [ ] Node-based visualization of pick patterns
- [ ] Node size = confidence level
- [ ] Connection strength = pick correlation
- [ ] Animated neural pulse effects

### **2. Strategy Heatmaps**
- [ ] 16x16 grid showing confidence success rates
- [ ] Color coding: green=high success, red=poor performance
- [ ] Interactive tooltips with detailed stats
- [ ] Week-by-week animation

### **3. Team Performance Matrix**
- [ ] 16x16 NFL helmet icons
- [ ] Reality vs perception analysis
- [ ] Contrarian value scoring
- [ ] Pick percentage vs win rate scatter plot

### **4. Leader Pattern Flow Diagrams**
- [ ] Sankey-style visualization
- [ ] Confidence allocation → outcomes → scoring
- [ ] Compare top performers vs average
- [ ] Strategy efficiency mapping

### **5. Weekly Trend Analysis**
- [ ] Chart.js line graphs
- [ ] User performance over time
- [ ] Consistency scoring
- [ ] Volatility indicators

# Triple-Backup Protocol Skill

Execute the documented TRIPLE-BACKUP WORK PROTECTION PROTOCOL for NerdFootball.

## Protocol Philosophy

**"Your work is now triple-protected: Local Git ‚Üí Remote GitHub ‚Üí Firebase Production"**

## When to Execute Triple-Backup

Execute ALWAYS after:
- ‚úÖ Completing a major feature or set of patterns
- ‚úÖ Before ending a long coding session
- ‚úÖ When user requests a backup/save
- ‚úÖ After generating substantial code (>1000 lines)
- ‚úÖ Before making architectural changes
- ‚úÖ At natural completion points (all tests passing, deployed, working)

## Triple-Backup Execution

### Step 1: Local Git Commit

```bash
git add .
git status  # Review what's being committed

git commit -m "[JIRA-ID if applicable]: [Detailed description]

- [Specific changes made]
- [Files affected]
- [Deployment status]
- [Features completed]

ü§ñ Generated with Claude Code
Co-Authored-By: Claude <noreply@anthropic.com>"
```

**Commit Message Guidelines:**
- Include JIRA ticket if available (e.g., `AF-456: Add PatternDNA library`)
- List specific changes in bullet points
- Note deployment status
- Mention features completed
- Keep description clear and actionable

### Step 2: Remote GitHub Push

```bash
git push origin main  # Or feature branch

# Verify push succeeded
git log -1
# Check GitHub web interface to confirm
```

**Push Verification:**
- Confirm push completed without errors
- Check GitHub repository for latest commit
- Verify commit appears in history
- Note commit hash for reference

### Step 3: Firebase Production Deploy

```bash
firebase deploy --only hosting,functions

# OR deploy separately:
# firebase deploy --only hosting
# firebase deploy --only functions

# Verify deployment
# Check deployment URLs and test in browser
```

**Deployment Verification:**
- Note deployment URLs from output
- Test critical production pages
- Verify no errors in browser console
- Confirm features working as expected

## Backup Verification Report

After completing all three backups, provide this formatted report to user:

```
‚úÖ ALL WORK SAVED AND BACKED UP!

Your work is now triple-protected:

1. ‚úÖ Local Git Commit
   Commit: [commit hash]
   Message: [commit description]

2. ‚úÖ Remote GitHub Push
   Branch: [branch name]
   Repo: https://github.com/tonyweeg/NerdfootballAI
   Status: Successfully pushed

3. ‚úÖ Firebase Production Deploy
   Hosting: https://nerdfootball.web.app
   Functions: [list deployed functions]
   Status: Deployment successful

What's Protected:
- [List of major files/features added]
- [Number of patterns/components created]
- [Lines of code added/modified]
- [Performance improvements achieved]

Recovery Strategy:
If anything happens, you can:
1. `git pull` to restore all files from GitHub
2. Read checkpoint files to resume work
3. All deployed features remain live on Firebase
4. Rollback to previous commit if needed

You're 100% safe! No work will be lost. üéØ
```

## Recovery Documentation

Create checkpoint files for large work sessions:

**Location:** `docs/WHERE-WE-LEFT-OFF-[FEATURE].md`

**Template:**
```markdown
# Checkpoint: [Feature Name]

**Date:** [Current date]
**Status:** [In Progress / Complete]
**Commit:** [commit hash]

## What Was Completed
- [Feature/pattern completed]
- [Files created/modified]
- [Tests written]
- [Performance improvements]

## Current State
- [Exact state of feature]
- [What's working]
- [What's tested]
- [What's deployed]

## Next Steps
1. [Next task to complete]
2. [Dependencies to address]
3. [Testing to perform]
4. [Documentation to update]

## Context for Resuming
- [Important decisions made]
- [Patterns established]
- [Edge cases to remember]
- [Known issues to address]

## Recovery Commands
```bash
git checkout [commit-hash]
firebase deploy --only hosting,functions
```

## Test URLs
- [List of URLs to test feature]
```

## Triple-Backup Checklist

### Pre-Backup
- [ ] All work completed and tested
- [ ] No uncommitted changes that should be excluded
- [ ] `.gitignore` properly configured (`.env` excluded)
- [ ] No sensitive data in commits

### Backup 1: Git Commit
- [ ] `git add .` executed
- [ ] `git status` reviewed
- [ ] Commit message follows guidelines
- [ ] Commit created successfully
- [ ] Commit hash noted

### Backup 2: GitHub Push
- [ ] `git push` executed
- [ ] Push succeeded without errors
- [ ] GitHub shows latest commit
- [ ] Remote repository updated

### Backup 3: Firebase Deploy
- [ ] Deploy command executed
- [ ] Deployment succeeded
- [ ] Production URLs tested
- [ ] Features verified working
- [ ] Performance targets met

### Post-Backup
- [ ] Backup Verification Report generated
- [ ] Checkpoint file created (if major work)
- [ ] User notified of successful backup
- [ ] Recovery strategy documented

## Common Issues & Solutions

**Issue: Git push rejected (behind remote)**
```bash
git pull origin main
# Resolve conflicts if any
git push origin main
```

**Issue: Merge conflicts on pull**
```bash
# Resolve conflicts in files
git add .
git commit -m "Merge: Resolved conflicts"
git push origin main
```

**Issue: Firebase deploy fails**
```bash
# Check Firebase login
firebase login

# Re-deploy
firebase deploy --only hosting,functions
```

**Issue: Sensitive data accidentally committed**
```bash
# Remove from history (dangerous!)
git filter-branch --force --index-filter \
  "git rm --cached --ignore-unmatch path/to/file" \
  --prune-empty --tag-name-filter cat -- --all

# Force push (ONLY if necessary)
git push origin --force --all
```

## Protection Layers

### Layer 1: Local Git Repository
- **Purpose**: Local version control and history
- **Recovery**: `git checkout [commit]`
- **Benefit**: Instant rollback to any previous state

### Layer 2: Remote GitHub Repository
- **Purpose**: Off-machine backup and collaboration
- **Recovery**: `git clone` or `git pull`
- **Benefit**: Survives local machine failure

### Layer 3: Firebase Production
- **Purpose**: Live deployment and user-accessible
- **Recovery**: Re-deploy from git
- **Benefit**: Features remain live even if code lost

## Quick Backup Commands

For experienced users, quick execution:

```bash
# Triple-backup one-liner
git add . && \
git commit -m "Backup: [description]" && \
git push origin main && \
firebase deploy --only hosting,functions
```

**‚ö†Ô∏è Warning:** Only use one-liner after thorough testing!

## Debug Patterns
```javascript
console.log('üíæ BACKUP:', 'Starting triple-backup');
console.log('‚úÖ GIT:', 'Committed locally');
console.log('‚úÖ GITHUB:', 'Pushed to remote');
console.log('‚úÖ FIREBASE:', 'Deployed to production');
```

## Success Criteria

Triple-backup is complete when:
1. ‚úÖ Local git commit created with descriptive message
2. ‚úÖ Changes pushed to GitHub successfully
3. ‚úÖ Firebase deployment succeeded
4. ‚úÖ Production verified working
5. ‚úÖ Backup Verification Report generated
6. ‚úÖ Checkpoint file created (if major work)
7. ‚úÖ User notified of protection status

## Diamond Level Standard

**"Every significant piece of work deserves triple protection. Never lose work. Always have a path back."**

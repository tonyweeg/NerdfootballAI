# üíé CLAUDE.md - Diamond Level Development Standards for NerdFootball

## Core Philosophy
**"Diamond Level" means absolute precision, no mistakes, and comprehensive verification at every step.**

## ü§ñ SPECIALIZED AGENTS
- **god-agent-dev-discipline** - All development work with absolute precision
- **verification-agent** - Claims verification and quality assurance
- **engine-architect-pharoah** - System architecture and technical design
- **fantasy-sports-ux-designer** - UI/UX design and user experience
- **firebase-deployment-specialist** - Production deployments and Firebase expertise

## üèÜ CURRENT PRODUCTION STANDARD - v2.1
**Main Branch**: `main` (all deployments)

### Core Application Files:
- `nerd-universe.html` - Main hub with terminal theme
- `help-ai-picks.html` - Wu-Tang AI prediction chamber
- `nerdfootballConfidencePicks.html` - Confidence pool (üêù KILLER BEES)
- `NerdSurvivorPicks.html` - Survivor pool
- `nerdfootballTheGrid.html` - The Grid
- `leaderboard.html` - All leaderboard displays

## üî• FIREBASE CACHE SYSTEM
**Performance**: Sub-500ms AI predictions and ESPN responses

### Cache Paths:
```javascript
// AI Cache: 15-minute expiry, 200-500ms loads
const aiCachePath = 'artifacts/nerdfootball/pools/nerduniverse-2025/cache/latest-ai-intel-sheet';

// ESPN Cache: 6-hour expiry, sub-500ms loads
const espnCachePath = 'cache/espn_current_data';
```

### Cache Performance:
| System | First Load | Cache Hit | Performance Gain |
|--------|------------|-----------|------------------|
| AI Predictions | 5-10s | 200-500ms | 99% faster |
| ESPN Data | 2-5s | <500ms | 90% faster |

## üêù KILLER BEES - CONFIDENCE FILTERING
**Feature**: Dynamic confidence dropdown filtering for locked games

### Core Logic:
- Locked games remove their confidence values from other dropdowns
- Real-time updates when confidence values change
- Console debug: üéØ CONFIDENCE_FILTER and üîÑ CONFIDENCE_REFRESH

## üöÄ ADMIN DASHBOARD
**URL**: https://nerdfootball.web.app/nerdfootball-system-architecture.html

### Authentication Pattern:
```javascript
// URL parameter (hamburger menu) ‚Üí Firebase Auth fallback
const adminUID = urlParams.get('admin');
if (adminUID && ADMIN_UIDS.includes(adminUID)) {
    window.history.replaceState({}, document.title, window.location.pathname);
    return true;
}
```

## üö® LEADERBOARD AGGREGATION FIX
**Issue**: Season leaderboard manual aggregation required
**Solution**: Modified `generateSeasonLeaderboard()` to manually sum weeklyPoints data instead of relying on stored season stats


## üõ°Ô∏è DEVELOPMENT WORKFLOW

### Recovery Commands:
```bash
# If anything breaks - instant recovery
git checkout main
firebase deploy --only hosting
firebase deploy --only functions
```

### Core Features (MUST ALL WORK):
- Hamburger menu navigation
- Confidence pool with locked game protection
- The Grid with pre-game security
- Survivor pool functionality
- Admin features
- No ghost users (okl4sw2aDhW3yKpOfOwe5lH7OQj1 blocked)

## üîß FIREBASE CONFIGURATION MANAGEMENT
**CRITICAL: Consistent Firebase configs prevent authentication disasters**

### üõ°Ô∏è Standard Firebase Configuration (USE THIS):
```javascript
const firebaseConfig = {
    apiKey: "AIzaSyDAF1MbAhL2uPIVUGMDlXvCqtknUUCX5Gw",
    authDomain: "nerdfootball.firebaseapp.com",
    databaseURL: "https://nerdfootball-default-rtdb.firebaseio.com",
    projectId: "nerdfootball",
    storageBucket: "nerdfootball.appspot.com",
    messagingSenderId: "969304790725",
    appId: "1:969304790725:web:892df38db0b0e62bde02ac"
};
```

### ‚ö†Ô∏è WRONG Configuration (NEVER USE):
```javascript
// WRONG - Different project, breaks authentication
const firebaseConfig = {
    apiKey: "AIzaSyC9bJIbGGTlwE21BDV1ihV6q3qQzm3Vpo8",
    messagingSenderId: "631080493141",
    appId: "1:631080493141:web:e7c5dde9013b0b4b60fe49"
    // ... other wrong values
};
```

### üîç Configuration Verification Checklist:
- [ ] **messagingSenderId**: Must be `969304790725`
- [ ] **appId**: Must be `1:969304790725:web:892df38db0b0e62bde02ac`
- [ ] **storageBucket**: Must be `nerdfootball.appspot.com`
- [ ] **projectId**: Must be `nerdfootball`


## üõ†Ô∏è AUTHENTICATION TROUBLESHOOTING GUIDE

### üö® "Admin Access Required" on Dashboard Refresh
**SYMPTOM**: Dashboard works initially but shows access denied on refresh
**ROOT CAUSE**: Firebase Auth state timing during hard refresh
**SOLUTION**: Always wait for `onAuthStateChanged` callback:

```javascript
async function waitForFirebaseAuth() {
    return new Promise((resolve) => {
        // ALWAYS wait for Firebase Auth to determine state
        // (don't assume null means undetermined vs logged-out)
        const unsubscribe = window.auth.onAuthStateChanged((user) => {
            unsubscribe();
            resolve(); // Auth state determined (user OR null)
        });

        // Timeout after 5 seconds
        setTimeout(() => {
            unsubscribe();
            resolve();
        }, 5000);
    });
}
```


### üö® Scoring System Path Issues - CRITICAL FIX
**SYMPTOM**: Scoring system finds zero picks despite users having made picks
**ROOT CAUSE**: Using wrong Firebase path - not matching The Grid's working path structure
**CRITICAL SOLUTION**: Use EXACT same path as The Grid (nerdfootballTheGrid.html:624):

```javascript
// WRONG (my attempts):
// `picks/pools/nerduniverse-2025/weeks/${weekNumber}/users/${userId}` (7 segments error)
// `artifacts/nerdfootball/pools/nerduniverse-2025/confidence/2025/weeks/${weekNumber}` (wrong structure)

// CORRECT (The Grid's working path):
const picksCollectionPath = `artifacts/nerdfootball/public/data/nerdfootball_picks/${weekNumber}/submissions`;
const picksDocRef = window.doc(window.db, picksCollectionPath, userId);
const picksSnap = await window.getDoc(picksDocRef);
return picksSnap.data(); // Direct user pick data
```

**NEVER USE** any other path structure for picks - ALWAYS copy The Grid's exact logic!


### üö® ESPN Timezone Bug (4-Hour Offset)
**SYMPTOM**: Game times show 4 hours early, games appear started when they haven't
**ROOT CAUSE**: ESPN uses EST as "Zulu" reference, NOT true UTC
**CRITICAL UNDERSTANDING**: ESPN "2025-09-18T20:15:00Z" = 8:15 PM EASTERN (not UTC)

**SOLUTION**: Apply ESPN EST-as-Zulu conversion logic
```javascript
// ESPN "Z" = Eastern Time, NOT UTC!
const cleanTime = espnTimestamp.replace('Z', '');
const easternTime = new Date(cleanTime);
const offsetHours = isDST ? 4 : 5; // EDT = UTC-4, EST = UTC-5
gameTime = new Date(Date.UTC(year, month, day, hours + offsetHours, minutes, seconds));
```

**DST RULES**: March 9 - November 2 (EDT), November 3 - March 8 (EST)

## üéØ Critical Standards

### 1. Testing BEFORE Deployment
- **ALWAYS** write and run tests before deploying
- Use Puppeteer for integration testing
- Use JEST for unit testing  
- Create comprehensive test plans for any significant change
- If tests fail, fix issues before proceeding
- Document all test results

### 2. User Data Integrity
- **Single Source of Truth**: Pool members (`artifacts/nerdfootball/pools/nerduniverse-2025/metadata/members`)
- **NO GHOST USERS**: Specifically eliminate `okl4sw2aDhW3yKpOfOwe5lH7OQj1`
- All 9 user displays must use pool members as the authoritative source
- No user should appear in any list if they're not part of a pool

### 3. Code Quality Standards
- **NO COMMENTS** in code unless explicitly requested
- **NO DOCUMENTATION FILES** (*.md, README) unless explicitly requested
- Follow existing code conventions and patterns
- Use existing libraries - never assume a library is available
- After completing tasks, run:
  - `npm run lint` (if available)
  - `npm run typecheck` (if available)
- Ask for these commands if not known, then document in CLAUDE.md

### 4. Functionality Preservation
- **NEVER** break existing functionality while adding new features
- **NEVER** lose features when fixing bugs
- Test comprehensively to ensure nothing is lost
- Maintain all existing UI/UX behaviors
- Keep all existing features when refactoring

### 5. Git & Deployment Discipline  
- **Commit BEFORE each new feature**: `git add . && git commit -m "Pre-feature: Working state before [feature name]"`
- **ONLY deploy after human regression testing passes**
- **Commit AFTER feature complete**: `git add . && git commit -m "Feature complete: [feature description]"`
- **Push to remote after human verification**: `git push` (only after user confirms feature works)
- Always verify both deployment and git push succeeded
- This enables easy rollback to last working state if issues arise

### 6. Communication Standards
- Be concise and direct - minimize output tokens
- Answer in 1-3 sentences when possible
- No unnecessary preambles or postambles
- No explanations unless requested
- Stop after completing task (don't explain what you did)

### 7. Task Management
- Use TodoWrite tool for complex multi-step tasks
- Mark tasks complete immediately when done
- Don't batch todo completions
- Break complex tasks into specific steps
- Track progress in real-time

### 8. Problem-Solving Approach
- **No shortcuts** - do things properly the first time
- **Surgical precision** - make targeted fixes, not broad changes
- Research thoroughly before implementing
- Understand existing code before modifying
- When in doubt, ask for clarification

### 9. Performance & Refactoring Standards
- **ESPN Cache Target**: Sub-500ms response times (achieved v3.0)
- **UI Response Target**: <100ms for user interactions
- **Survivor Pool Target**: Sub-100ms loading (90x improvement achieved)
- **Always scan for similar patterns** when fixing performance issues
- **Check for N+1 query problems** in any database-related code
- **Search codebase for duplicate inefficient logic** before concluding refactoring
- **Seek user approval** before implementing broader performance optimizations
- **Document performance improvements** with before/after metrics
- **Cache First**: Use ESPN Firebase cache system to eliminate API timeouts
- Example: If fixing `getDocs(collection(db, users/${user.id}/...))` in one function, search entire codebase for similar patterns

### 10. Cross-Impact Analysis Standards
- **CRITICAL**: Before removing/modifying any code element, search entire codebase for dependencies
- Use `grep` to find all references to variables, functions, DOM elements before deletion
- Check if shared functions/elements are used by multiple features
- When removing UI elements, verify corresponding JavaScript references are safe
- Example: Removing `#leaderboard-body` requires checking if `allUI.leaderboardBody` is used elsewhere
- Ask user for confirmation when potential cross-impacts are identified

## üö® Known Issues to Always Check

### Ghost Users
- The ghost user `okl4sw2aDhW3yKpOfOwe5lH7OQj1` must NEVER appear
- Always verify ghost elimination after user-related changes
- Use pool members to prevent ghost users

### Critical Features That Must Work
1. **ESPN Cache System**: Sub-500ms performance, zero timeout disasters
2. **Game Credit System**: Users get credit when games show FINAL status
3. **UI Security**: Buttons disabled for completed games, proper game state display
4. **Picks Summary**: "Your Active Picks" and "Season Leaderboard"
5. **The Grid**: Must show picks only after games start (security)
6. **URL Routing**: Parameters like `?view=rules` must work
7. **Admin Functions**: Add/remove users from pools
8. **Pool Settings**: Must display correct users
9. **Authentication**: Users must be able to sign in/out

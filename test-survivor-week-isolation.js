/**
 * DIAMOND LEVEL TEST: Survivor Week Isolation Fix Verification
 *
 * This test verifies that the survivor logic bug is fixed where:
 * - User picks Team A in Week 1, Team A wins ‚Üí User gets life
 * - User picks Team B in Week 2, Team A loses in Week 2 ‚Üí User should still have Week 1 win
 *
 * Bug was: Week 1 picks were being validated against current week ESPN data
 * Fix: Each week's picks are now validated only against that week's ESPN data
